# Well-Architected II - time for a new framework?

Over ten years ago we wrote *Well-Architected* to help people build better
systems. It set a standard - and others followed. Fourteen plus frameworks
later, most haven't kept pace with how we *really* build and operate
technology today.  

So... is it time for **Well-Architected II**?

Those who know me know I don't trust my instincts or opinions too much -  
I'd never write a new version without data. So, a quick poll:

**Should we create Well-Architected II?** [https://well.architected.to/](https://well.architected.to/)[^1]

* ✅ Yes - time for a new one
* 🤔 Maybe - needs discussion
* 😐 No opinion / unsure
* 🚫 Please don’t - sequels fail

Comment if you think something's missing - or what you dislike about today's
frameworks. I'm also keen to hear **how** you'd want to access it: book,
mobile app, or dev tooling? And whichever you choose - what's the *one thing*
you'd want from it?

Many of the current frameworks suffer from the same issues:  
- Overly complex, vendor-biased  
- Too large, not bite-sized or actionable  
- Slow to adapt to platform engineering and AI realities  
- Certification grind over actual learning  
- Brownfield refactoring ignored  
- Tooling: missing, lacks dependency and visualisation  
- Not reacting to industry learnings: Wardley Maps, Residuality Theory,
  vibe coding  
- Missing key focus areas like:  
  * Platform engineering / developer experience  
  * AI / Data  
  * Business and product alignment  
  * Governance / ethics  
  * Multi-cloud / cross-platform and vendor  

If we're going to create *Well-Architected II*, it has to be **data-driven, cross-vendor, lean, and effective** - the sort of framework that just works.

`.to` it is. A small reminder that WA2 should be practical over theoretical.
